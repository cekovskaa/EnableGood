      <p>
        Today, companies are under growing pressure to show real progress on ESG
        goals. At the same time, NGOs are working tirelessly to create social
        and environmental change â€” but often struggle to connect with the right
        partners and secure lasting support.
        <br /> Despite shared intentions, the connection between businesses and
        NGOs is often broken:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Companies don't know where to start or how to find aligned,
          trustworthy partners.
        </li>
        <li>
          NGOs lack the visibility and tools to present their work in ways
          companies can easily engage with.
        </li>
        <li>
          Partnerships are often slow, one-sided, or lack long-term alignment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reporting and impact tracking are manual, inconsistent, and confusing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These challenges create missed opportunities, wasted time, and
        partnerships that never reach their full potential.
        <br /> That's why Enable Good exists:
        <br /> To make partnerships between companies and NGOs easier, smarter,
        and more impactful so both sides can focus on what really matters: doing
        good.
