      "We’re used to platforms that feel transactional—where NGOs are expected to pitch constantly and hope for attention. Enable Good flipped that dynamic. Here, we found companies already interested in collaboration, already aligned with our values. The partnership we built on this platform wasn’t forced—it felt like a natural extension of our mission. We’re now co-developing workshops on urban sustainability with corporate teams we genuinely admire.",

      "As an organization that facilitates partnerships between businesses, NGOs, and municipalities, we’re always looking for ways to move faster without losing alignment. Enable Good gave us a way to surface partners we wouldn’t have found otherwise—organizations doing bold, local work that aligns with global SDGs. The platform’s ecosystem approach means we’re not just checking boxes—we’re building coalitions. One connection even led to a tri-sector pilot program that’s now scaling in two regions.",

Just being on the platform added legitimacy to our story—and within a month, we were invited to speak at a circular fashion roundtable. That kind of recognition creates momentum. We’re not just surviving anymore—we’re scaling.",

      "Most ESG platforms are built for metrics, not relationships. Enable Good is the opposite—it starts with human connection, and lets the data support it. We use it to identify grassroots initiatives that align with our carbon reduction goals, but what really makes a difference is how authentic the partnerships feel. Every profile tells a story. Every collaboration we’ve started here has led to impact that feels deeply personal to our team.",
